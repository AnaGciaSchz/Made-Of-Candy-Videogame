## DESCRIPTION
Made of Candy is a videogame inspired by the Robbie Williams song "Candy". It talks about a guardian angel that is in love with an awakened girl who he must protect from the world.

In this game you are the guardian angel and you have to move the different enemies and obstacles that can hurt the girl. Your objective is to reach the final of the level with the girl. There are 5 different levels, with a recolectable in each one. If you find the 5 recolectables, you will get a reward.
